HTML Cleaner
=================================================

Eventually, we want to be able to crawl the web and parse web pages into plain text words. As such, we must be able to remove all of the HTML code from web pages. This assignment is a step towards this functionality.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------

The official name of this homework is `HTMLCleaner`. This should be the name you use for your Eclipse Java project and the name you use when running the homework test script.

See the [Homework Guides](https://usf-cs212-fall2018.github.io/guides/homework.html) for additional details on homework requirements and submission.
